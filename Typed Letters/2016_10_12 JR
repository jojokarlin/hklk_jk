I/eye being a storm center

From Pragmatism -- William James and the cosmic weather

Emanuel Swedenborg ANIMAL KINGDOM -- needs to be framed 
	- end of part II
	- kingdom of the soul -- how it manifests in parts of the body
	- embryology and the development of human being
	- summation of breath, lungs, what it all means
	- not only a summation. the way he details body parts -- notes to different words that he uses. see his corrections/elaborations -- correcting for parallax -- what you must understand fully to imagine how breath and soul are moving through the body

Attaching particular meaning (white horse of revelation) -- one-to-one laying out of new testament symbology to naturalize the old and new testament -- make it connected to nature

Velikovsky -- 

Losing of egotism involved in becoming more transparent oneself
Transparent eyeball comes from

Swedenborg 9 ranks of angels -- center is Godhead -- simply pure light

ELABORATE
metaphor -- outer ranks are too material, ego

angels describe what we now think about electron domains

kusheri -- model of divine comedy

UC Berkeley
Devin Zuber -- dissertation Swedenborg/Kant
did Swedenborg have access to Ibn Arabi?

The Monist -- 
readership -- intellectual scholars

Wave Theory -- in "Open Fields" -- journals in 19th century Am -- public was more interdisciplinary -- generalist approach

specialization of university; of disciplines -- early 20th cen.

PROGRESS.
enlargement of what humans know
substitute "amplification" for "progress" -- recuperate what was and taking more and more -- more and more bits of information
wave particle analogy

VAGUE in William James --
restore "vague" to scrutiny by the intellect
Homeric Greek -- wave in the sea is the same as pregnant woman
play on vague in french vs onde (round) -- all the various wave disruptions -- all that motion and interaction

passage p 61 Context in American Pragmatism 
"the indivizualized self is a part of the content of world experience"
"The body is the storm center-- I is primarily a noun of position"

location of the I vis-a-vis the activity of the world
orienting subjectivity -- so that activity moves through -- orienting yourself so that you can see or you can hear

getting out of the shape of grammar we've inhabited 

score our language -- as musical score
set language in a way that you have different signs

development of a thought in James -- super or sub script -- subtext
Peirce existential graphs
to show transformation of an idea

Emerson- genius is a mutation of the thing itself
mutations as attempts
Schrodinger getting into the genome

p 100 in Mind and Matter
feeling your way (as in the dark) -- know you're right by FEELING
A Guess at the Riddle -- trust the animal connection to the planet that this might be right
level of feeling is what the AESTHETIC is -- aesthetic from feeling -- operate out of sense of importance of the body itself
if what you're guessing isn't in relation to what is happening -- letting it go -- stay tuned to thing
Christine -- what your mind does when you're sleeping -- these are the important things

Pay attention to dreams -- without filter -- gathering from daily experience what connects with you 

Pragmatism -- examine all our efforts -- turn away from what is practical or might be useful in next generation
getting rid of what's not useful or productive
having to create new platform of action 
strain -- it hurts
hard to start new 

Schopenhaur -- point to need to move away from privileging of reason -- some other manner of receiving information from the cosmos

Swedenborg - Henry James Sr -- 

need to be "the author" or "the poet" is incidental

Science Times 
BEES

activity -- storm center
p 151 Some Consequences

attention -- focus
bringing back attention
more practice the more able you are
fulcrum of where one's attention falls
	- act as funnel through which past comes into the present
	- moving past into present
	- Edwards close attention of the mind in thinking
	- slit that the atom goes through before smearing on the other side
	- tighter the aperture, greater the flow
	- sound of a particular word triggers whole wave packet
	- attention smears into the present-- range most apt for the present
	-- attention will be the filter 
	- range of possibility -- constellate -- score -- with depth -- dimensionalized -- what the brain activity is

Continuous quantity
	- reduces itself in the last anlaysis to time
	- 

Whitehead -- event -- something that occurs in time
	- your ability to focus has to do with being in a space-time moment

p151 Some Consequences -- on memory
attention attaches thought to thought at another time

seeking unknown in an equation -- through transforms until you solve for the unknown

attention -- is on the constellation -- zoom in and out -- but awareness of the whole -- nature of the thing that you want to solve
attention -- is a stretching -- attenuation -- net -- consciousness itself
aim -- unknown -- following the clues

AUTUMN
The leaves are falling, falling as if from far up,
as if orchards were dying high in space.
Each leaf falls as if it were motioning "no."

And tonight the heavy earth is falling
away from all other stars in the loneliness.

We're all falling. This hand here is falling.
And look at the other one. It's in them all.

And yet there is Someone, whose hands
infinitely calm, holding up all this falling. 
Rainer Maria Rilke

every object of attention has its own logic
Peirce -- geometry is always triplicate
middle term -- immediate object of attention

levels of attention - as we amplify the object of our attention increases -- remove ego identify with the planet -- more information is coming into the object of attention -- identifying with system, not person-self --

attention is always what you come to know as your experience increases -- 

attention -- what is my relation to this system

reading should envelop process itself 

A man must be alone -- separated from the bustle -- to develop conversation with Nature -- Emerson

immediate failure of free association -- unconscious linearity

Jason - Christopher Bolas -- orange cake
DBT - EMDR - schema -- trying to get at the unconscious without holding it in time? getting at the place of thought

Christine -- Genet using language -- undoes word Cholera -- Cho le roi --unnaming

dimming of the lightbulb
float in half-light

Gustave Fechner -- lower threshold of perception -- Mary Lydon -- roll back to booming buzzing confusion of child entering the world as the screen
Fechner's figure -- ordinary consciousness is archipelago of islands -- tidal situation -- tide goes out and reveals all connected
physicist -- angels what are they?
messages -- messages in what we read -- chord and vibration
find our way through history by angels

child's 

paying attention -- praxis for critiquing Cartesian logic
deconstruction of Cartesian self-love - 

beginning of systems theory

Gadamer insisting we enter situations with prejudice -- we are situated where we are 
understanding is medial -- bodies in motion bodies in thought

Mandler -- origins of conceptual thought --

Mark Bruhn - A Mirror in the Mind ***

crossing of the chromosome -- information transfer
chiasmus -- linguistic representation-- return to a primary mode of human perception that is visual -- bilateral
visual storage -- helps in repeated pattern recognition
physiological accident --
enables children to recognize where not to go -- 

basic conceptual framework that we have
prelinguistic -- W Stevens evokes pre-grammatic registration


Some Consequences -
effects are habits -- p 152
never one-to-one objective rendering -- colored by our nervous system 

Plato's Cratulus -- long discussion about whether in things of themselves something that elicits the name of them -- within the dialogue there are examples 
R -- rolling
Nature Magazine -- study phonetic sounds 62% of world languages -- 74 sound-meaning associations --
R ---- round
tongue -- L or E
emerged independently --
intuitive linked sounds

p155 Some Cons
ideal first is the particular thing-in-itself

Dr. Erwin Corey on Ed Sullivan
Sibyl Kempson 

"The real, then, is that which, sooner or later, information and reasoning would finally result in, and which is therefore indepent of the ageirs of me and you. Theus the very origin of the conception of reality shows that this coneception essentially invovles the notion of a COMMUNITY."

crowd sourcing
collective attention to communal problem
consciousness extended in space and time

content of consciousness is sign resulting from inference
sign = description
collective residues of our experience -- re-establishing homeostasis 

"men and words reciprocally educate each other." p 156 Peirce

organism is only an instrument of thought

importance of setting an aim -- middle-of-the-road method meaning you know where you are and want to see where to go from there -- 

isolate the possibility of participating in the work of the community
