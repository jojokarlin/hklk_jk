<>Len</> dear,
<p>Sitting in the quiet of our living room trying to think of something of interest to write you but with no luck.</p>
<p>Last night Irv, Rick + I listened to the radio most of the night some fairly good programs including good music. We listened to Allen Young's program. heard him once before and am very impressed with his show- darn good humor. Got to bed about 11 P.M. but couldn't fall asleep for hours. Just hoping + thinking about you + Pat. Evenings are the loveliest of all except for weekends which seem to be endless. The boring life we lead is getting everyone down- I've watched a few of my men and they have been actually sick- homesick- no kidding. it's depressed quite a few - on in particular Cpt. Bob Melquist, a very fine chap, clean cut + faithful, whose wife is expecting this month - poor kid- Rick has been kind of blue lately too - guess that's because he had no mail for a few days- yes, dear, a letter a day helps keep the blues away- I know that I too have felt lonelier than usual this past week and although I usually manage to conceal my feelings, I know that I haven't been as pleasant as I might be and perhaps am more irritable than usual.</p>
<p>I woke at 7 A.M. this morning and after a good breakfast for a change, went into Linz to finance office and picked up the pay for the Med. Det. - $3,333.00 all in schillings which makes an impressive looking bundle of money.</p><pb>
<p>I then had to make the rounds of all the battalions and before the day was trough I imagine I covered 150 miles in all. I went to 1st B.N. in the morning - Schley is gone + only the MAC officer remains - the men shed no tears at Schley's departure- I came back to 3rd BN after that + paid my men, then took Irv with me for the remainder of the day. Went to 2nd BN and then to Regimental Aid Station which is about 15 miles from here- Several men who are sick in the hospital or on leave weren't paid and I have over $200 left which I must turn in to Finance tomorrow and thus relieve myself of all responsibility. Thank goodness it balanced to the last cent - usually the paying officer loses or figures on losing a few dollars- A new MC officer arriver today + is at Regiment- seems to be a very likeable chap- I think his name is Capt. Walters- he's been overseas 18 months - had a separate collecting company + has exactly 85 points - He's very jovial, honest about himself + others, and although very anxious to get home is annoyingly patient + willing sweat it out here for 3-4 months more, although he knows that he is going home- Guess one gets resigned + complacent after being over here for one or two years- I've noticed it several times already in these men who have been away from home for a number of years + their indifference <pb>
i actually frightening. I can't ever picture myself getting like that - what a terrible thought!!</p>
<p>I understand that the Russians are now in Leonfelden and the people are learning, but by bitter experience, how well off they are, or rather were, with the Americans- I wish that they would let Russia occupy all the conquered territories so these damned people could feel what the results of war really are. Under our regime these people haven't felt a thing yet and I'm quite disgusted + dislike these people more + more. They are not to be trusted, are arrogant + thick-headed + obstinate. I don't bother trying to point out to them the sins they committed + the crimes of the war they waged- they're immune to that + have a million alibis.</p>
<p>Tonight I received a letter from Bob + a package from you but no mail. Thanks, darling for the package, seems like old times seeing that familiar shoe box size- Bob didn't have much to say except he decided that it was best not to see Sally any more - although he didn't sound sad, he certainly didn't seem happy- said that he would write more once he got sailing again- Guess I'll take a shower + get to bed early tonight. I'm quite tired at present but as usual, not sleepy at all- Darling thanks again for those medical journals but most of them are so old, 1943, 1944, that the treatment + articles discussed are outmoded. I appreciate your wonderful thoughtfulness though, dear. As a <pb>matter of fact, I love you. Come to think of it, I adore you. Then again, you're the finest person I know + conincidentally the most wonderful wife in the world + our little Pat is the sweetest girl in the world and I'm the proudest man in the world. 
Send my love to Helene, Jim + It. Goodnight my adorable sweets.  I adore you + lvoe you with all my heart + soul-
<closing>All my love, forever + ever + always

P.S. A million hugs + kisses.
